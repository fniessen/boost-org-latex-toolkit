#+DESCRIPTION: Toolkit to enhance Org mode LaTeX export with custom LaTeX classes, Beamer themes, reusable setup files, and Emacs Lisp integration.
#+KEYWORDS:  Org mode, LaTeX, Emacs, Beamer, texmf, document classes, PDF export
#+LANGUAGE:  en

* Overview

This repository contains a coherent set of tools designed to improve and
structure LaTeX export from Org mode, with a particular focus on:

- custom LaTeX classes,
- dedicated Beamer themes,
- Org configuration files for LaTeX,
- an Emacs Lisp integration to declare and use these classes.

The repository follows an organization compatible with a local =~/texmf=
installation and with an Org mode oriented Emacs configuration.

* Repository structure

** =docs/=

Contains documentation related to the "mc" LaTeX classes:

- =Using-the-MC-LaTeX-Class.pdf=
- =Using-the-MC-LaTeX-Class.tex=

These files describe how to use the LaTeX classes provided.

** =lisp/=

- =org-mc-latex-classes.el=

Emacs Lisp file intended to declare *custom LaTeX classes for Org mode*. It
enables Org to export documents using the classes defined in this repository.

** =org/=

=.setup= files intended to be included in Org files; for example:

- =beamer-fonts.setup=
- =latex-hyperref.setup=
- =latex-listings.setup=

These files are used to centralize reusable LaTeX settings during export from
Org mode.

** =texmf/=

Directory structure compliant with a local TeX installation.

*** =texmf/tex/latex/mc/=

Custom LaTeX classes and styles:

- =.cls= classes (article, report, book, CV, contract, etc.),
- shared =.sty= style files.

These files define a coherent family of LaTeX documents under the "mc" prefix.

*** =texmf/tex/latex/beamer-mc/=

Custom Beamer themes:

- theme files =.sty=,
- corresponding Org sources =.org=.

Those themes are generated from and documented using Org mode.

*** =texmf/tex/latex/generic/images/=

Generic images used by the LaTeX classes or themes.

* Project goals

The project goals are:

- provide ready to use LaTeX classes,
- facilitate Org mode export to these classes,
- centralize recurring LaTeX settings,
- offer Beamer themes consistent with the document classes.

* Usage in Org mode

** LaTeX installation

Make sure TeX can find the classes:

1. Copy or link the =texmf/= directory into your local =~/texmf=.
2. Update the TeX file database if necessary:

#+begin_src shell
texhash ~/texmf
#+end_src

** Emacs installation

Make Org export use the =mcreport= class by adding the Lisp file to your Emacs
configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/PATH/TO/boost-org-latex-toolkit/lisp")
(require 'org-mc-latex-classes)
#+end_src

The exact path depends on the local location of the repository.

Then select the class in your Org file:

#+begin_src org
#+LATEX_CLASS: mcreport
#+end_src

** Set document metadata in Org

Org standard metadata keywords are used to populate the LaTeX document.

In your Org file:

#+begin_src org
,#+TITLE:     Your document
,#+AUTHOR:    Your name
,#+EMAIL:     Your email
,#+DATE:      \today
,#+DESCRIPTION: Short description of the document purpose.
,#+KEYWORDS:  Org mode, LaTeX, Emacs
,#+LATEX_CLASS: mcreport
#+end_src

What Org guarantees during LaTeX export:

- =#+TITLE:= → =\title{Your document}=
- =#+AUTHOR:= → =\author{Your name}=
- =#+DATE:= → =\date{\today}=

Regarding the additional fields:

- =#+DESCRIPTION:= is exported to LaTeX as document metadata (for example PDF
  metadata) when supported by the class and packages in use.
- =#+KEYWORDS:= is exported as LaTeX metadata in the same way.

The exact visual or semantic use of *DESCRIPTION* and *KEYWORDS* depends entirely
on:
- the LaTeX class (for example =mcreport=),
- and the packages it loads (for example =hyperref=).

** Include the repository's reusable LaTeX setup snippets (optional)

You may include the =.setup= files (provided in the =org/= directory) in an Org file
with:

#+begin_src org
,#+SETUPFILE: /PATH/TO/boost-org-latex-toolkit/org/latex-hyperref.setup
,#+SETUPFILE: /PATH/TO/boost-org-latex-toolkit/org/latex-listings.setup
#+end_src

The exact behavior depends on the content of each =.setup= file.

** Minimal complete Org example

#+begin_src org
,#+TITLE:     Your document
,#+SUBTITLE:  Project overview
,#+AUTHOR:    Your name
,#+EMAIL:     Your email
,#+DATE:      \today
,#+DESCRIPTION: Example document generated from Org mode.
,#+KEYWORDS:  Org, LaTeX, Emacs, MC
,#+LATEX_CLASS: mcreport

,* Introduction

Some content.

,* Conclusion

More content.
#+end_src

Export with:

- =C-c C-e l l= to generate the LaTeX file, or
- =C-c C-e l o= to generate and open the PDF (depending on your configuration).

The resulting LaTeX file will include:

- =\documentclass{mcreport}= and
- standard title metadata.
